Chatbot for incoming EUSS Freshies

Hello world, my name is Christopher, the President for the Edinburgh University Singapore Society for the 2020/2021 Academic year.
I am an EEE and Com Sci student here at the University of Edinburgh, and a project I want to learn involves creating a Chatbot for people wanting to apply to Edinburgh, or just the UK in General from Singapore.

Hopefully, I'll be able to create a bot that aspiring students can ask that will answer most of the question they have, or at least direct them in the correct direction. This will save alot of time between both the Exco as well as the Students. I wish for this bot to be able to be updated easily (maybe some UI of sorts in the future).
